# Goals
- Get user comments and titles from r/reddevils, get sentiment over time and visualize united results over time. It would be nice if a blackbox sentiment analyzer can predict 
sentiment that correlate with united points
- How does sentiment at reddevils compare with at city when they won EPL or when real madrid won UCL ?
- Post match threads might be more targetted.
- Track how sentiment associated with a specific player changes over time
    - Is fan base excited about a particular player based on transfer rumours ? 
    - Can we see pogba's rise and fall over the years ?
    - Can we see hate towards owners or viewers ?
- GPT-T for time series modelling, given many sequences of player performances or server health can GPT-T predict
